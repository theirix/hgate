Forked and improved version by theirix.
Original hGate tool was from https://bitbucket.org/shedar/hgate
Converted from Bitbucket (from https://bitbucket.org/theirix/hgate) to the GitHub due to sunsetting Mercurial support.

hGate is a tool for managing users and repositrories when using Mercurial and HgWebDir.
If you use Mercurial as a main control version system, and repositories are located at one of your servers, then you have to login to your server to create a new repository, create a new user or change it`s password, give rights to a user for a specific repository and so on. hGate makes above tasks easier.
It is opensource and free software under GPLv2 licence.

Main features
creating repositories

creating, deleting, changing of groups of repositories
editing main configuration parameters of hgwebdir

view of access rights of a user - show matrix of rights for different repositories
